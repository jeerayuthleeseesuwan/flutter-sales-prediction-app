# Flutter Sales Prediction App
In this project, I built a predictive model (Artificial Neural Network model) that can forecast sales of products in different outlets and deploy it onto this Flutter mobile application.

## Key features of this application:
1. Able to predict future sales amount based on the variables provided by users
2. Able to recommend a better value for certain variables that can increase the predicted value.
3. Has a built-in dashboard (constructed with the sales dataset used to build the model)
4. Has the slice and dice feature which allows users filter the data just by clicking on the bar chart.
5. Has biometric authentication, where users have to authenticate with their fingerprint or face ID.

The sales dataset is taken from Kaggle:
